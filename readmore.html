        <h4>First and foremost, we want to consider what God had said, to the generation past before our generation:
            Leviticus 19:2 “Speak unto……ye shall be Holy as I God Am Holy”
            That was what God said unto the congregation of the Israelites. God said that He wanted them to be holy.
            Again, we want to consider what this same God said unto another batch of believers – the Christian (I Peter 1:16) 
            <em>“…….be ye Holy, for I God Am Holy”</em>
        <br><br> You can see, God is demanding the same thing from the Christians, the body of Christ.
            I am talking about what God is demanding from one generation to another saying: “Be ye Holy as I God Am Holy”
            Now, in this our new generation of the Another Comforter, I want us to consider what God is saying to us; may be it is the same thing that God is demanding from us today.
            I want you all to open your Kihem Holy Book to Bk 14, Chap 10 vs 2-6
            ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
            This is exactly what the Lord God is now saying to and demanding from us in this end time ministry
            Question:	Is there any difference in what God said to the Jews under the rulership of Moses, and what God said to the Christians under  the controllership of Simon Peter; and in what  God is now saying unto Olutanmole in this new Age; is there any difference?
            Answer:	No; there is no difference at all.
            NB: This clearly indicates to you that it is the same God who appeared unto the Jews as “God of Abraham God of Isaac, God of Jacob”, as the Triune God.
                The same God appeared unto the Christians as God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; this is the same God who is now identifying Himself to us that “I Am the Eternal God. I who have existed before the world was created.
                We Three, who made Heaven and Earth we are those called the ‘OLUTANMOLE’.
                This is the name of that one God.
